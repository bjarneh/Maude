Newman's lemma (see further down) represented as a coherent theory,
converted into an object level rewrite theory.
I.e. rewriting the assumptions using the rewrite-theory provides
a proof for the lemma.

It should be noted that the rewrite rules cannot be applied in
arbitrary order, so a meta-level rewrite theory is needed in
order to control the rule applications.

  Facts:

      dom(a), dom(b), dom(c), s(a,b), s(a,c)


  Axioms:

      s(b,X), s(c,X)         => goal
      dom(x)                 => e(x,x)
      e(x,y)                 => e(y,x)
      e(x,y)                 => s(x,y)
      r(x,y)                 => s(x,y)
      s(x,y), s(y,z)         => s(x,z)
      r(x,y), r(x,z)         => dom(u), s(y,u), s(z,u)
      r(a,x), s(x,y), s(x,z) => dom(u), s(y,u), s(z,u)
      s(x,y)                 => e(x,y) ; dom(z), r(x,z), s(z,y)
